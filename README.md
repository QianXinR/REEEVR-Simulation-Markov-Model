# REEEVR-Simulation-Markov-Model
This is a simulated Markov model that will randomly generate base case inputs based on the number of health states, treatment arms, and specific assumptions.

The randomly generated inputs, along with the associated uncertainty for each input, are then used to test the reliability of the value of information (VOI) analysis, particularly the expected value of perfect information (EVPPI), using various methods.
